# Calculation-of-closeness-and-betweenness-scores

Import parquet files, create graph and calculate the above mentioned scores

Execution of the mentioned file gives the desired output

Closeness centrality indicates how close a node is to all other nodes in the graph. Betweenness centrality quantifies how many times a particular node comes in the shortest chosen path between two other nodes
